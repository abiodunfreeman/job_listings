## What I learned
    I learned about the .every method which helped in being able to filter the job postings 
    based on what the user chooses. 

    The .every method returns true if every variable in the array its appended to passes a test. 
    In this case if every filterOption is in the Card.props.filterList it returns true, thus
    adding the Card to the newCardList.
